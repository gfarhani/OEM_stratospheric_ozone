These are codes for the stratopsheric ozone retrievals for this paper:

Farhani, G., Sica, R. J., Godin-Beekmann, S., and Haefele, A.: Optimal estimation method retrievals of stratospheric ozone profiles from a DIAL, Atmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 2097â€“2111, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2097-2019, 2019.

The codes work for OHP Lidar in France.

By making some small changes you can use it for stratsophspheric ozone retrievals for all lidars.
The method is based on the Optimal Estimation Method. 
*** To get the retrievals, you NEED to have the Qack poackage as well ***

1) The main code to run is called oem_test7_308_353_OHP.m
2) You need all other files to run this one
3) Loading data happens inside: makeQ_test7_308_353_OHP.m
